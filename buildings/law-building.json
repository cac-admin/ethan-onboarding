Macdonald\u201d from the law school building, as recommended by Principal and Vice-Chancellor Patrick Deane following his acceptance of recommendations made by Dean Mark Walters, Dean of Faculty of Law, and a report from a special committee set up to consider the situation.", "\u201cThis decision is grounded in the university\u2019s present-day academic mission and commitment to honour the values of equity, diversity, and inclusivity and to ensure all students, faculty, and staff feel welcome within the Queen\u2019s community,\u201d says Principal Deane. \u201cIt also supports our commitment to take action to address systemic racism and ensure every member of our community may enjoy the benefits of our institution equally.\u201d", "The decision follows a two-month public consultation process that saw more than 3,000 members of the Queen\u2019s community and others submit feedback to the Macdonald Hall Consultation Advisory Committee. The decision honours the university\u2019s commitment to support equity, diversity, and inclusivity and the special responsibility of law schools included in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission Report.", "\u201cSir John A. Macdonald is rightly celebrated for his central role in the founding of modern Canada and the creation of our country\u2019s constitution. However, a more complete understanding of his legacies has emerged in recent years. In particular, we now have a richer and better understanding of the hurtful views and policies he and his government advanced in relation to Indigenous peoples and racial minorities,\u201d said Dean Mark Walters. \u201cWhat was made clear through our consultations is that the Macdonald name sends a conflicting message that interferes with the values and aspirations of the current law school and Queen\u2019s community where Indigenous and racialized students must feel welcome and included.\u201d"], "location": "The Law Building is located on Union Street, east of the Robert Sutherland Building.", "entrances": ["North (main & accessible):\nThe main entrance is accessible with a level entry and automatic door opener.
