Embracing the principles of interactivity and integration, the facility is home to the creative arts at Queen's: the Dan School of Drama and Music, the Department of Film and Media, and the Bachelor of Fine Art program all share the teaching and performance spaces within.", "The opening of \"The Isabel,\u201d the nickname applied to the new facility by the Queen\u2019s community, in 2014 was long awaited. For a campus vibrant with academic creativity, Queen\u2019s early years were often short on the performing arts. There were many wonderful performances by the Glee Club, the Faculty Players and student and faculty musicians, but these were hindered by the lack of suitable performance venues. Despite a glorious hammer-vault ceiling, Convocation Hall (which opened in 1878) offered a limited stage and imperfect acoustics. Grant Hall (1905) had 900 seats, but once again the acoustics were challenging and had to contend with winter heating. Other campus stages \u2013 in Dunning Hall and McArthur Hall, for instance \u2013 alleviated the situation for some kinds of performances.", "A series of student-led initiatives through the 1900s made a performance space seem within reach, but each one eventually fell through. The 21st century dawned and, despite the presence of a thriving School of Music, a bachelor of Fine Arts program, film studies and a cycle of annual drama productions, Queen\u2019s still lacked a big stage. The, in the early 2000s, Drs. Alfred and Isabel Bader expressed their interest.", "The Baders had long supported the visual arts at Queen\u2019s, endowing the Agnes Etherington Art Centre with a trove of European art. Their promise of a lead donation prompted Principal Karen Hitchcock into negotiations in 2006 with the City of Kingston for a choice waterfront site just west of the main campus. Now, Queen\u2019s had sufficient momentum for a performance space.", "By 2009, the financing was in place: a remarkable $31-million in donations from the Baders, followed by $15 million in matching contributions from the federal and provincial governments. Queen\u2019s, the City of Kingston and many other generous donors helped make the Isabel a reality.", "The Centre's building, was designed by Snohetta,\u00a0a Norwegian architectural firm, and N45 Architects of Ottawa as a partnership of the two firms. It incorporate the existing heritage buildings of the Morton's brewery (1840), stable buildings, and the Stella Buck building into the modern facility.", "In the fall of 2014, the 80,000 square-foot, $72-million Isabel Bader Centre for the Performing Arts opened to architectural and cultural acclaim.
