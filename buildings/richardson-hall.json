W.E. McNeill, the retired Vice Principal and Treasurer, wrote that \"the splendour of the administration building, especially its furnishings, is the topic of gossip. Two rooms have broadloom carpets from wall to wall; all offices have rugs and drapes.\" Even Principal Mackintosh was said to be uncomfortable in such opulence.", "In addition to its main function, Richardson Hall served at one time as the home of the Queen's Post Office, the Maintenance Department, and the offices of the Faculties of Arts and Science and Applied Science.", "The building was renovated in 2008.", "It now houses the Principal's Office, the offices of several Vice-Principals, and the University Secretariat."], "desc_src": "https://www.queensu.ca/encyclopedia/r/richardson-hall", "access": ["Location: Richardson Hall is located on University Avenue between Dunning and Ellis Halls.", "Entrances", "East\nThere is a main entrance at the front of the building that has stairs leading up to it to the first level, and also a ground level entrance that is accessible with an automatic door opener.", "West\nThe rear entrance does not have an automatic door opener.
